## BUG-001 — Cap-stop transcode hang / permanent failure (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Recordings under ~2:30 transcode in ~1 minute and work reliably.
- Recordings run to the auto-stop cap (~3:00) hang for many minutes, then fail or poison later attempts.
- After a bad cap run, even short recordings fail until the extension is reloaded.
- Console shows large payloads, e.g. `bytes: 14698030, base64Chars: 19597376` (~14.7 MB WebM → ~19.6 M base64 chars).

### Root causes (confirmed)

1. **Payload size + base64 relay** — The pipeline sends the full WebM from content script → background → offscreen FFmpeg, then returns the full MP4 the same way. Each hop uses base64 strings. At ~15 MB raw WebM, expect ~20 M base64 chars outbound and a similar order of magnitude for the MP4 return. Peak memory holds multiple copies (encode buffer + JSON message + decode buffer).

2. **Canvas video bitrate** — `MediaRecorder` uses `videoBitsPerSecond: 2_500_000` plus `audioBitsPerSecond: 128_000` on a 640×360@24fps waveform track. Audio alone would be tiny; the **video track dominates file size** (~100+ KB/s observed). Three minutes of waveform video is far heavier than three minutes of audio would be.

3. **Cap auto-stop WebM integrity** — Stopping via `setTimeout` at the recording cap races with MediaRecorder's 1s `timeslice`. The final chunk can be truncated or malformed. FFmpeg then hangs or exits 1 on all strategies. See `claude-progress.md` (cap transcode hang history).

4. **Per-strategy timeout scaled with file size (fixed 2026-06)** — Early hardening used `45s + 20s×MB`, which allowed **~345s per strategy** on a 15 MB file. A hung `ffmpeg.exec()` on corrupt cap WebM blocked the UI for ~6 minutes *per strategy* before failing over.

5. **Poisoned FFmpeg singleton (fixed 2026-06)** — `disposeFfmpeg()` was not called after failures; the offscreen WASM worker stayed corrupted until extension reload.

### Evidence

| Recording length | WebM bytes (observed) | Transcode outcome |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| ~2:20 (manual stop) | 14,698,030 | Success in ~1 min |
| ~3:00 (cap stop) | ~15,000,000+ | Hang / fail; breaks subsequent jobs |

Size alone does not explain the gap (similar MB). **Cap-stop corruption + long strategy timeouts + worker poisoning** explain it.

### Mitigation (2026-06, `pretty` branch)

- **Recording cap reduced to 2:00** — `DISPLAY_MAX_RECORDING_SECONDS = 120`, enforced at 120s (true 2:00/2:00; the old 2s underflow was for Reddit's 3:00 upload check). Sacrifices Reddit's nominal 3:00 headroom for pipeline stability.
- **Strategy timeout capped at 90s** — `ffmpeg-runner.ts` `STRATEGY_TIMEOUT_MAX_MS`.
- **FFmpeg worker lifecycle** — `disposeFfmpeg()` on failure/timeout; offscreen job queue; per-strategy timeouts.
- **Theme assets** — `assets/backgrounds/*` added to `web_accessible_resources`.

### Deferred architectural rework (do not forget)

To restore a 3:00 cap safely:

1. **Chunked binary transport** — Avoid single `runtime.sendMessage` blobs; use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` chunks or `postMessage` to offscreen with `ArrayBuffer` transfers where possible.
2. **Lower waveform video cost** — Reduce `RECORDER_VIDEO_BPS`, fps, or resolution for long recordings; or audio-only WebM with static poster frame for Reddit.
3. **Cap-stop hardening** — Guaranteed MediaRecorder flush before cap stop; validate WebM cluster integrity before sending to FFmpeg.
4. **MP4 return path** — Stream or chunk MP4 back; avoid holding WebM + MP4 base64 simultaneously in the content script.
5. **Optional: terminate offscreen document** after each job to guarantee clean WASM state.

## BUG-002 — Intermittent `ArrayBuffer is already detached` (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Cap-stop transcode sometimes fails with: `Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker': ArrayBuffer at index 0 is already detached.`
- Other cap runs on the same build succeed; behavior is intermittent.

### Root cause (confirmed)

`@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` `writeFile()` **transfers** the underlying `ArrayBuffer` to the WASM worker (zero-copy). Our fallback transcode loop reuses the same `Uint8Array` for up to five strategies — the first `writeFile` detaches the buffer; the second strategy's `writeFile` throws.

Secondary race: calling `disposeFfmpeg()` / `terminate()` on strategy timeout while `ffmpeg.exec()` is still settling can surface the same error unless the exec promise is ignored after timeout.

### Fix (2026-06)

- `writeInputWebm()` passes `inputBytes.slice()` (fresh buffer per strategy).
- `runWebmToMp4()` and offscreen unpack use `.slice()` so relay buffers are never aliased.
- `execWithTimeout()` uses a `settled` guard so late exec rejections after timeout/terminate are ignored.

### Why the pipeline feels fragile

Several **independent sharp edges** stack non-linearly:

| Layer | Fragility |
|-------|-----------|
| MediaRecorder cap stop | 1s timeslice race → occasional corrupt WebM |
| FFmpeg WASM | Single worker, virtual FS, buffer transfer semantics |
| chrome.runtime messaging | Full-file base64, size limits, no streaming |
| MV3 service worker | Can sleep; needs keep-alive during transcode |
| Dev HMR | Content script reinjection mid-job duplicates console noise |

Failures are intermittent because **cap-stop chunk integrity and buffer lifetime are timing-dependent**, not deterministic. Reducing cap to 2:00 and fixing buffer copies removes two major edges; the rest need architectural rework (BUG-001 deferred items).

## BUG-003 — Client timeout on healthy jobs / stall false positives (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- ~1 minute (~2.3 MB) recordings sometimes hit client timeout while cap-stop and short clips work.
- Console shows multiple `Sending WebM for transcode` lines with **different jobIds** (sequential recordings, not one job duplicated).
- UI sits on "Converting…" until stall/timeout despite FFmpeg eventually succeeding on retry.

### Root causes (confirmed)

1. **Fixed wall-clock client timeout** started at `sendMessage`, not when progress moved — slow WASM cold start or offscreen queue wait consumed the budget before transcode began.
2. **Five sequential FFmpeg strategies** — each failure/timeout opened another stall window (up to 75–90s each).
3. **No progress heartbeat** — offscreen sent nothing while FFmpeg loaded WASM, so the content script assumed a stall.
4. **Overlapping transcode timers** — back-to-back recordings could overlap client timers before offscreen queue drained (mitigated with `transcode-lock.ts`).

### Fix (2026-06)

Explicit pipeline checks at every hop (no heuristics):

| Stage | Explicit check |
|-------|----------------|
| Content script | `validateWebmRecording()` (browser video metadata) |
| Content pack | `verifyWebmPackedBinary()` (base64 shape + EBML magic) |
| Background relay | `validateTranscodeStartRequest()` + immediate ACK |
| Offscreen unpack | `assertWebmBytes()` |
| FFmpeg output | `assertMp4Bytes()` (ftyp box) + `verifyMp4PackedBinary()` |
| Content receive | `verifyMp4PackedBinary()` before Blob |

**Stall detection:** content script fails only after **45s without any progress message** (including offscreen heartbeats every 8s). Absolute ceiling 6 minutes.

**Fewer strategies:** `h264-aac` then `faststart` only; one offscreen job retry with worker dispose + 400ms settle.

## BUG-004 — WebM preflight rejects valid MediaRecorder blobs (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Clicking Stop crashes the recorder popup with `Uncaught (in promise) Error: Recording has no playable duration`.
- Happens immediately after stop, before transcode begins.

### Root cause (confirmed)

1. **Chrome reports `video.duration === Infinity`** for MediaRecorder WebM blobs that lack a Duration EBML element — this is normal, not corruption; FFmpeg transcodes them fine.
2. `validateWebmRecording()` used `!Number.isFinite(video.duration)` which rejects `Infinity`.
3. **`stopRecording()` did not catch** preflight errors — only `transcodeToMp4()` had `setError` handling.

### Fix (2026-06)

- Accept `Infinity` duration when metadata loads without `onerror`.
- Brief `durationchange` wait for transient `NaN` right after stop.
- Wrap preflight + transcode in `stopRecording` try/catch → `setError`.

## BUG-005 — Orphan transcode jobs / double send / progress flicker (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Console shows two `Sending WebM for transcode` lines with **different jobIds and byte sizes** from what felt like one recording.
- Progress pegs at **20%** for long stretches; brief flicker to **~35%** then back to 20%.
- Second (smaller) job sometimes succeeds while the first appears hung; long waits before completion.

### Root causes (confirmed)

1. **Not a duplicate relay of one blob** — byte sizes differ (e.g. 1.57 MB then 407 KB) = two separate `stopRecording` → transcode chains.
2. **Orphaned async `stopRecording`** — `openRecorderPanel()` / `RecorderPanel.open()` calls `dispose()` on the old session but does not abort in-flight preflight/transcode. The old session object keeps running and enqueues job 1 while a new session enqueues job 2.
3. **`transcode-lock` serializes jobs** — job 2 waits behind job 1 in the content script; UI may be bound to job 2 while job 1 blocks the lock → multi-minute waits.
4. **20% peg is expected FFmpeg mapping** — transcoding stage reports `0.2 + ratio * 0.75`; WASM often stays at 0.2 until `progress` events fire. **35%** ≈ brief `progress` (~0.2) before strategy retry resets to 20%.

### Fix (2026-06)

- `sessionEpoch` + supersede checks: skip transcode if panel disposed/reopened during preflight.
- `AbortController` on client transcode: `dispose()` / `cancel()` release lock and listeners immediately.
- Enter `processing` phase **before** WebM preflight (UI cannot re-stop during validate).
- Monotonic progress reporting (never regress 35% → 20% in UI).

## BUG-006 — Infinite transcode hang (heartbeats mask stall) (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- ~1 minute recordings sometimes finish in ~3s, sometimes hang indefinitely until manual cancel.
- UI pegs at ~20% converting; no client timeout even past 90s.
- Console shows normal `Sending WebM for transcode` / preflight logs; no obvious error.

### Root causes (confirmed)

1. **Heartbeats counted as progress** — Offscreen emits `*-heartbeat` progress every 8s. Content script reset its 45s stall timer on *any* progress message, so a hung `ffmpeg.exec()` or `loadFfmpeg()` never tripped client stall detection.
2. **Client abort did not stop offscreen** — BUG-005 aborted the content listener and released `transcode-lock`, but FFmpeg kept running in the offscreen queue, blocking subsequent jobs.
3. **`loadFfmpeg()` had no timeout** — A stuck WASM fetch/load could heartbeat forever without reaching `execWithTimeout`.
4. **Absolute client ceiling was 6 minutes** — Too long for user-facing failure on a ~2 MB clip.

### Fix (2026-06)

- Stall timer resets only on **meaningful** progress (ratio increase or non-heartbeat stage change).
- `MSG_TRANSCODE_CANCEL` propagates client/background cancel → offscreen `disposeFfmpeg()` + queue skip.
- Background **supersedes** prior tab job when a new transcode starts.
- Offscreen **90s wall-clock** per attempt; `loadFfmpeg` **30s** timeout.
- Client absolute max reduced to **90s**.

### Design lesson

Heartbeats were **syntactic** health checks. Project rule going forward: **semantic health checking** — see `docs/engineering-principles.md`.

## BUG-007 — FFmpeg frame duplication storm on bad WebM timestamps (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Same-length recordings sometimes transcode in ~10s, sometimes hang or crawl at `speed` ~0.2× until client/offscreen timeout.
- FFmpeg logs show `dup` climbing with frame count (e.g. `dup=984` at frame 1006) and **"More than 1000 frames duplicated"**.
- Input probe reports `vp8 … **1k tbr, 1k tbn**`, often `Duration: N/A`.
- Output stream shows **~1000 fps** instead of ~24 fps.

### Root causes (confirmed via offscreen logs, 2026-06-21)

1. **Broken/missing video PTS in MediaRecorder WebM** — `canvas.captureStream(24)` + `MediaRecorder` can emit WebM where FFmpeg infers a bogus **1000 fps** timebase (`1k tbr`).
2. **No timestamp normalization in encode strategy** — `h264-aac` in `ffmpeg-runner.ts` passes through with no `-r`, `-fps_mode`, `-vsync`, or PTS repair.
3. **CFR sync duplicates frames** — FFmpeg stretches sparse real frames across the bogus timeline → thousands of libx264 encodes in WASM (`threads=1`).
4. **Preflight does not catch it** — `webm-preflight.ts` treats `Duration: N/A` / `Infinity` as normal Chrome behavior (BUG-004); no check for `1k tbr` or dup-prone metadata.

### Healthy baseline (for comparison)

- Input `~22 tbr`; output `~22 fps`; `dup` single digits; `speed` 4–5×; ~44s clip → ~10s transcode.

### Likely triggers

- Reddit tab **backgrounded** — `requestAnimationFrame` stalls; bursty/sparse canvas frame timestamps.
- **Cap-stop races** — see BUG-001; truncated final chunks may worsen timestamp gaps.
- Stop/`requestData` timing edge cases.

### Fix (2026-06-21, pretty-9)

1. **Primary encode** (`h264-aac`): `-fflags +genpts+igndts`, `-fps_mode passthrough`, `-r 24` — avoids CFR dup to bogus 1k fps timeline.
2. **Fallback encode** (`h264-aac-fps`): `-vf fps=24` when passthrough strategy still dup-storms.
3. **Early abort**: log watcher sets dup-storm flag when `dup≥100`, dup/frame ≥ 0.5, or “More than N frames duplicated”; strategy aborts in ~200ms and retries next strategy instead of hanging at 75s.
4. **Remux fallback** (`faststart`) unchanged as last resort.

## BUG-008 — Settings popup blank after dulcet-4 (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Extension settings popup opens as an empty ~10px-tall box (correct width, no content).
- Brief hang before render; no UI from `entrypoints/popup/main.ts`.

### Root cause (confirmed)

**Circular ESM import:** `src/voice/types.ts` re-exported `resolve-config.ts`, which imports `types.ts` and `presets.ts` (which imports `types.ts`). Popup loads `clip-appearance-summary` → `voice-summary` / `clip-profiles` → `voice/types` → cycle → module init failure before `innerHTML` is set.

### Fix (2026-06, `dulcet`)

- Removed re-exports from `types.ts`.
- Consumers import `voiceEffectIsActive`, `voiceEffectConfigsEqual`, `scaleVoiceEffectByIntensity`, `resolveVoiceEffectConfig` from `resolve-config.ts` directly.
- Guard comment on `types.ts`; barrel `index.ts` documented as offscreen-only.

### Prevention

- Never re-export `resolve-config` from `types.ts`.
- Popup/settings UI: use direct paths (`voice-summary`, `resolve-config`, `types`) — not `@/src/voice` barrel (pulls `process-audio` → ffmpeg-runner).

## BUG-009 — Intensity slider dropped bundled voice preset (2026-06)

### Symptoms

- Moving intensity 1–10 switched voice preset dropdown to **Custom**.
- Preview/export sounded like pitch-only custom, not the selected preset (Robot, Deeper, etc.) at reduced strength.

### Root cause (confirmed)

`voice-controls.ts` intensity handler set `presetId: 'custom'` on every slider move (copied from pitch-knob behavior). Intensity is a modulation layer on the active preset, not a fork to Custom.

### Fix (2026-06, `dulcet`)

- Intensity handler keeps `presetId`; only updates `intensity` / `turbo`.
- Added `resolveVoiceEffectConfig()` — rebuilds bundled preset SFX from `presets.ts` + applies user `intensity`/`turbo`/`enabled` (mirrors visual preset + `designOverrides`).
- Export/preview: `resolveVoiceEffectConfig()` → `scaleVoiceEffectByIntensity()`.
